# What is:
$&$" Peaceware was made with the aim of combating viruses and trojans by doing a full scan on your device "$&$

# User Options:
*The user has 2 options!!:

1- Regular scan - The program will scan 100% of each file.

2- Quick scan: the program will search for the virus in the first 20% of the file and the last 20% of the file.

# Arguments received by the program
*The program receives 2 arguments!!:

1- The virus sign that contains the virus we are looking for in the directory.

2- a path from a directory - will include the directory of the files we want to scan.

**&$%$ Attention: At the end of each scan, a ScanLog text file will create, it will contain a summary of the scan. $%$&**

*$good luck to all :) $* / "By: Marcio Vinicius"
